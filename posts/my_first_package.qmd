# My very first package
I am pleased to announce that my very first real package is available on GitHub : [SpatialBernoulli](https://github.com/caroline-cognot/SpatialBernoulli.jl)

![Some realisations of a spatially correlated binary variable...](../images/6fd2db61-1.png)


# Installation

The package runs on julia 1.11 and above.
In a Julia session switch to `pkg>` mode to add the package:

```julia
julia>] # switch to pkg> mode
pkg> add https://github.com/caroline-cognot/SpatialBernoulli.jl
```
To run an example, see documentation.

For now, model fitting relies on Optimization.


# How did I build this package ?

Followed instructions from

- https://julialang.org/contribute/developing_package/ for the creation of the package using PkgTemplates
- https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/man/guide/ for setting up the documentation
- https://m3g.github.io/JuliaNotes.jl/stable/publish_docs/ for publishing the documentation

# How did I build this page ?

Followed the code of [Léo Micollet](https://leomicollet.github.io/) who followed the instructions of [Lucia Clarotto](https://luciclar.github.io/) who followed the instructions she gave us in [StateoftheR session](https://stateofther.netlify.app/post/quarto-website/).
