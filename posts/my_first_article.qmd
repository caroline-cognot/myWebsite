# Publication success !

I am pleased to announce that my very first paper is published here : [A spatio-temporal weather generator for the temperature over France](https://ascmo.copernicus.org/articles/11/203/2025/). It is a joint paper with my supervisors, Liliane Bel, Sylvie Parey and David Métivier.

It talks about the modelling of mean daily temperature at the scale of France, incorporating trends, seasonality and spatio-temporal geostatistics.
